### About

Curio is a social platform designed to let users manage and share family heirlooms and artefacts in a fun an intuitive way.

### Background

Most families own numerous heirlooms or artefacts with great sentimental value. They may wish to catalogue these possession so that they can digitally share them with other family members or document who is to inherit each artefact. Currently there is no mainstream mobile or web application dedicated to the cataloguing of family artefacts.

Current solutions to this problem are cumbersome and unintuitive. For example, users can organise artefacts in a spreadsheet and manually organise photos in folders on their computers or a cloud storage service. This solution is inconvenient and non-interactive. Users can also utilise social platforms such as Facebook groups or Pinterest boards to add interactivity with their friends and family. These solutions are not purpose built for artefact management so they feel “hacky” and lack a lot of the functionality a dedicated solution can bring.

Curio is a cross-platform app made to address this issue by providing an all-in-one platform dedicated to documenting, organising and sharing family artefacts. It is designed to be intuitive and fun to use so that cataloging and sharing artefacts is a joy to do rather than a chore.
